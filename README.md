# iMac_server_mode or Dell 3443 Server mode
This project dealt with southbridge chipset on mainboard of the iMac or Dell 3443. My friends don't want to dive deep down to register level. It looks so deep for them to explore the knowledge, except me. 
The work instruction for creating server mode on 2007 iMac or Dell 3443 is in iMac_server_modeApp.swift. This project does not involve any line of code. I had to create swift files since Xcode needs that. Please understand! Thanks for visitting my github!
